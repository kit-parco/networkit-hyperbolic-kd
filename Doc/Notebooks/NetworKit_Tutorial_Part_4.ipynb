      "### Betweenness Centrality\n",
      "If you interpret the Facebook graph as web link graph in the previous Q&A session, the obvious ranking choice is the PageRank. Note that today it is only one of many aspects modern web search engines consider to rank web pages. However, we were looking for the eigenvector centrality as MIT8 is a social network (both and possibly others can be applicable, though).\n",
      "\n",
      "In applications where the flow of goods, vehicles, information, etc. via shortest paths in a network plays a major role, *betweenness centrality* is an interesting centrality index. It is also widely used for social networks. Its drawback is its rather high running time, which makes its use problematic for really large networks. But in many applications we do not need to consider the exact betweenness values nor an exact ranking. An *approximation* is often good enough.\n",

      "1. In the *PGP network*, compute the 15 nodes with the highest (exact) betweenness values and order them accordingly in a ranking.\n",
      "**Answer:**\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Perform the same as in 1) with one difference: Instead of using the algorithm for computing exact betweenness values, use the RK approximation algorithm. Use also values different from the default ones for the parameters $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$. What effects do you see in comparison to the ranking based on exact values? What about running time (you can use %time preceding a call to get its CPU time)? And how do the parameter settings affect these effects?\n",

      "### Further Applications of Clustering/Community Detection\n",
      "Subgraphs that are internally dense and externally sparse, i.e. communities or clusters, are not only useful in social or other complex networks. Outside network analysis, there are numerous applications as well. As an example, consider image segmentation. This fundamental step in image processing refers to the identification and separation of image regions. Typically, this is done to separate different objects in the image from each other and to simplify the image before applying other image processing tools.\n",

      "## Concluding Remarks and Further Reading\n",
      "NetworKit is steadily growing and already offers more than can be treated within this tutorial. Take a look at the project website and our papers for more information. We would be very happy if you decided to use NetworKit on a regular basis, be it as a user or as a developer. Since NetworKit is an open-source project, feedback and contributions are welcome (and have already happened in the past). The email list `networkit@ira.uni-karlsruhe.de` is the place for general discussion and questions. Also feel free to contact the authors with questions on how NetworKit can be applied in your research.\n",

      "# Tutorial \"Algorithmic Methods for Network Analysis with NetworKit\" (Part 1)\n",
      "Welcome to the hands-on session of our tutorial! This tutorial is based on the user guide of NetworKit, our network analysis software. You will learn in this tutorial how to use NetworKit for fundamental tasks in network analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "NetworKit can run in your browser (thanks to IPython notebooks) and is still very fast (thanks to C++ code in the background). It is easy to mix text with code and solutions in this environment. Thus, you should be able to obtain your results in a convenient and quick manner. This is not only true for the rather small graphs we use for this tutorial, but for larger instances in production runs as well. In particular you can mix text, code, plots and other rich media in this environment. Since this allows a simplified execution and interpretation of experiments, the interactive approach followed by NetworKit can simplify the cyclic algorithm engineering process significantly (without compromising algorithm performance).\n",

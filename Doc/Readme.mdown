NetworKit
=========

[NetworKit][networkit] is a growing open-source toolkit for high-performance
network analysis. Its aim is to provide tools for the analysis of large
networks in the size range from thousands to billions of edges. For this
purpose, it implements efficient graph algorithms, many of them parallel to
utilize multicore architectures. These are meant to compute standard measures
of network analysis, such as degree sequences, clustering coefficients and
centrality (see next sections of this document for a list of existing features
and a roadmap of planned features). In this respect, NetworKit is comparable
to packages such as [NetworkX][networkx], albeit with a focus on parallelism 
and scalability. NetworKit is also a testbed for algorithm engineering and
contains a few novel algorithms from recently published research, especially
in the area of community detection (see list of publications below).

As of release 2.0, NetworKit is meant to be built into a Python extension
module. High-performance algorithms are written in C++ and exposed to Python
via Cython. Python in turn gives us the ability to work interactively and a
rich environment of tools for data analysis and scientific computing, such as
`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `networkx`, `numpy` and `scipy`. A static command line
program for community detection can still be built (see build instructions
below), but we focus our efforts on the interactive Python environment.

### Documentation

In addition to this `Readme`, the `NetworKit_UserGuide` provides an introduction to the NetworKit tools, in the form of an interactive IPython Notebook. The `DevGuide` is meant for developers who would like to contribute. When using NetworKit as a Python module, refer to the docstrings of classes, methods and functions. C++ sources are also documented in Doxygen format.

To convert the documentation markdown files to PDF install the [pandoc](http://code.google.com/p/pandoc/downloads/list) utility and call the script `docs2pdf.sh`.

### E-Mail List

For questions regarding NetworKit, subscribe to our [e-mail list][list] (`networkit@ira.uka.de`) and feel free to ask.

Requirements
------------

### Compiler: 

A C++ compiler supporting C++11 (we use GCC 4.8). The compiler and linker flags `-fopenmp -std=c++11` are required.


### Libraries:

- `OpenMP`		for parallelism

To avoid possible binary incompatibilities, try to build these libraries with the same compiler that will be used to build NetworKit. 



Building NetworKit as a Python Module
--------------------------------------

As of version 2.0 NetworKit is meant to be used as a Python extension module. To build the module, the following is required:

- Python 3 (>= 3.3 recommended)
- Cython

Additionally, the module uses the following external Python packages:

- `networkx`
- `tabulate`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`

The functionality of NetworKit available to Python is greatly reduced without these packages. 
These are best installed via `easy_install` or `pip`. (If you have multiple Python installations, be sure you use the commands matching your Python 3 version. In the following examples, `python3` and `pip3` will be used.) 

	pip3 install package_name


Then, switch to the top folder and run the script `setup.py` with the following options:

	python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace [--optimize=V] [-jX]

The script will call scons to compile NetworKit as a library and then build the extensions in the folder `src/python`. By default, NetworKit will be built with the amount of available cores in optimized mode. It is possible the add the options `--optimize=V` and `-jN` the same way it can be done to a manual scons call.
The setup script provides more functionality:
	
	python3 setup.py develop [--uninstall] [--optimize=V] [-jX]
	
will compile NetworKit, build the extensions and on top of that temporarily install NetworKit so that it is available on the whole system. This can be undone by adding `--uninstall`. 

	python3 setup.py clean [--optimize=V]
	
will remove the extensions and its build folder as well as call scons to remove the NetworKit library and its build folder specified by `--optimize=V`.

Assuming the extension module `NetworKit` exists, it can be imported in python:

	python3
	>>> import NetworKit


Interactive Work with NetworKit
-------------------------------

With NetworKit as a Python extension module, you get access to native high-performance code and can at the same time work interactively in the Python ecosystem. Although the standard Python interpreter works fine, we recommend IPython as a great environment for scientific computing. IPython can also be installed via `pip` or `easy_install`.  For tab completion in ipython you may also need to install `readline`. The following should work: `pip3 install readline ipython`. 

After the requirements are satisfied, start IPython and import NetworKit.

	ipython3
	>>> from NetworKit import *

Now you should be able to use NetworKit interactively. For usage examples, refer to the `UserGuide`.


IPython Notebook
----------------

We recommend that you familiarize yourself with NetworKit through experimenting with the interactive IPython Notebook `NetworKit_UserGuide.ipynb` located in the folder `Doc/Notebooks`. To display and work with these notebooks, you have to start a local notebook server from the terminal with:

	ipython3 notebook --pylab inline

Your default browser should open a web interface named "IPython Dashboard". You can either add `NetworKit_UserGuide.ipynb` from the above mentioned location, or you can point IPython to the location by starting it with

	ipython3 notebook --pylab inline --notebook-dir=Doc/Notebooks

The notebook appears in the list and you can start it by clicking on it. 


Building the C++ Core only
--------------------------

We recommend [SCons](http://scons.org) for building the C++ part of NetworKit. Individual settings for your environment will be read from a configuration file. As an example, the file `build.conf.example` is provided. Copy this to `build.conf` and edit your environment settings. Then call `scons`.

The call to SCons has the following options:

	scons --optimize=<level> --target=<target>

where `<level>` can be

- `D` 	debug
- `O`	optimized
- `P`	profiling

and `<target>` can be

- `Core`				build NetworKit as a library, required by the Python shell		
- `Tests`				build executable for the unit tests	
- `CommunityDetection` 	build executable for static, global community detection algorithms (deprecated)

For example, to build NetworKit as an optimized library, run
	scons --optimize=O --target=Core

To speed up the compilation on a multicore machine, you can append `-jX` where X denotes the number of threads to compile with.

Logging is enabled by default. If you want to disable logging functionality, add the following to your scons call:

	--logging=no

Alternatively, the project can be built with Eclipse. Our Eclipse and CDT project files are included as examples in the `[eclipse/` directory. Copy them to the project file location, import the project into Eclipse and modify depending on your needs.



Test
----

You actually don't need to build and run our unit tests. However if you experience any issues with NetworKit, you might want to check, if NetworKit runs properly. Please refer to the `Unit Tests and Testing` section in our DevGuide.pdf

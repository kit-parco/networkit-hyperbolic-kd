NetworKit
=========

[NetworKit][networkit] is a growing open-source toolkit for high-performance
network analysis. Its aim is to provide tools for the analysis of large
networks in the size range from thousands to billions of edges. For this
purpose, it implements efficient graph algorithms, many of them parallel to
utilize multicore architectures. These are meant to compute standard measures
of network analysis, such as degree sequences, clustering coefficients and
centrality (see next sections of this document for a list of existing features
and a roadmap of planned features). In this respect, NetworKit is comparable
to packages such as [NetworkX][networkx], albeit with a focus on parallelism 
and scalability. NetworKit is also a testbed for algorithm engineering and
contains a few novel algorithms from recently published research, especially
in the area of community detection (see list of publications below).

As of release 2.0, NetworKit is meant to be built into a Python extension
module. High-performance algorithms are written in C++ and exposed to Python
via Cython. Python in turn gives us the ability to work interactively and a
rich environment of tools for data analysis and scientific computing, such as
`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `networkx`, `numpy` and `scipy`. A static command line
program for community detection can still be built (see build instructions
below), but we focus our efforts on the interactive Python environment.

Requirements
------------

### Compiler: 

A C++ compiler supporting C++11 (we use GCC 4.8). The compiler and linker flags `-fopenmp -std=c++11` are required.


### Libraries:

- `OpenMP`		for parallelism
- `Googletest` 	for unit testing
- `log4cxx` 	for logging

The following preprocessor definitions (using the `-D` compiler flag) remove these dependencies, but also some functionality:

- `NOLOGGING`	removes all log statements
- `NOLOG4CXX`	replaces log statements with `std::cout` output if `log4cxx` is not available - loglevel `TRACE` becomes fixed.


Building the Base
-----------------

We recommend [SCons](http://scons.org) for building the C++ kernels of NetworKit. Individual settings for your environment will be read from a configuration file. As an example, the file `build.conf.example` is provided. Copy this to `build.conf` and edit your environment settings. Then call `scons`.

The call to SCons has the following options:

	scons --optimize=<level>--target=<target>

where `<level>`can be
	- `D` 	debug
	- `O`	optimized
	- `P`	profiling
and `<target>` can be
	- `Core`				build NetworKit as a library, required by the Python shell		
	- `Tests`				build executable for the unit tests	
	- `CommunityDetection` 	build executable for static, global community detection algorithms (deprecated)

For example, to build NetworKit as an optimized library, run
	scons --optimize=O --target=Core

To speed up the compilation on a multicore machine, you can append `-jX` where X denotes the number of threads to compile with.

Alternatively, the project can be built with Eclipse. Our Eclipse and CDT project files are included as examples in the `[eclipse/` directory. Copy them to the project file location, import the project into Eclipse and modify depending on your needs.



Test
----

Next, verify that the code was built correctly: Run all unit tests with 

		./NetworKit-Tests --tests --gtest_filter=*Test.test*

The expression after `--gtest_filter=` selects the tests.

Run performance tests with

		./NetworKit-Tests --tests --gtest_filter=*Benchmark*


Building NetworKit as a Python Module
--------------------------------------

As of version 2.0 NetworKit is meant to be used as a Python extension module. To build the module, the following is required:
- Python 3.3 or newer
- Cython

Additionally, the module uses the following external Python packages:

- `networkx`
- `tabulate`

These are best installed via `easy_install` or `pip`. (If you have multiple Python installations, be sure you use the commands matching your Python 3 version. In the following examples, `python3` and `pip3` will be used.) 

	pip3 install package_name


The next step is to compile NetworKit as a library with

	scons --optimize=O --target=Core

After everything is compiled, switch to the cython folder and use the build script (`build.sh`) or manually call

	python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

This will create the extension module `NetworKit`. The resulting module can be imported in python:

	python3
	>>> import NetworKit


Interactive Work with NetworKit
-------------------------------

With NetworKit as a Python extension module, you get access to native high-performance code and can at the same time work interactively in the Python ecosystem. Although the standard Python interpreter works fine, we recommend IPython as a great environment for scientific computing. IPython can also be installed via `pip` or `easy_install`.  For tab completion in ipython you may also need to install `readline`. The following should work: `pip3 install readline ipython` 

After the requirements are satisfied, start IPython and import NetworKit.

	ipython3
	>>> from NetworKit import *

Now you should be able to use NetworKit interactively, here are some examples:


	>>> G = readGraph("../input/jazz.graph")
	>>> ccs = ConnectedComponents()
	>>> ccs.run(G)
	>>> ccs.numberOfComponents()
	>>> GraphProperties.minMaxDegree(G)
	>>> GraphProperties.averageLocalClusteringCoefficient(G)



Running the Executables
-----------------------

Warning: As of version 2.0, NetworKit is meant to be used as a Python module, so the following interface will be phased out and is deprecated.

### NetworKit-CommunityDetection

Required options for community detection are `--algorithm` and `--graph`.

Main algorithms:


	PLP		Parallel Label Propagation
	PLM		Parallel Louvain Method
	EPP		Ensemble Preprocessing

Example calls:


		./NetworKit-CommunityDetection-O --algorithm=PLP --graph=path/to/a.graph
		./NetworKit-CommunityDetection-O --algorithm=EPP:4*PLP+PLM --graph=path/to/a.graph
		./NetworKit-CommunityDetection-O --algorithm=PLM --graph=path/to/a.graph --runs=10 --summary=path/to/file.csv


The `--graph` option accepts graph files in a format known as the [METIS file format][metis], a simple adjacency list format. Many example files can be found in the collection of the [10th DIMACS Implementation Challenge][dimacs]. 

The default loglevel is INFO, add `--loglevel=DEBUG` for more or `--loglevel=ERROR` for less verbose output.

By default, all available threads will be used. To explicitly set the number of threads, use

	--threads=8

To perform 42 runs of the algorithm per graph, add

	--runs=42

To append key result data to a CSV file, add

	--summary=/path/to/file.csv

To save the clustering produced, add

	--saveClustering=/path/to/file.clust

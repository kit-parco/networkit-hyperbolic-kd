NetworKit.CommunityDetection
============================

This is the first component of the high-performance network analysis package [NetworKit][networkit]. In this component, the focus is on community detection (or graph clustering). 

 The amount of graph-structured data has recently experienced an enormous growth in many applications. To transform such data into useful information, high-performance analytics algorithms and software tools are necessary. One common graph analytics kernel is community detection (or graph clustering). Despite extensive research on heuristic solvers for this task, only few parallel codes exist, although parallelism is often necessary to scale to the data volume of real-world applications.

We address the deficit in computing capability by a flexible and extensible clustering algorithm framework with shared-memory parallelism. Within this framework we implement our parallel variations of known sequential algorithms and combine them by an ensemble approach. In extensive experiments driven by the algorithm engineering paradigm, we have identified the most successful parameters and combinations of these algorithms. The processing rate of our fastest algorithm exceeds 10M edges/second for many large graphs, making it suitable for massive data streams. Moreover, the strongest algorithm we developed yields the best tradeoff between quality and speed for graph clusterers to date.

Requirements
------------

###Compiler: 

- compiler supporting C++11 (we use GCC 4.7)


###Libraries:

- `OpenMP`	
- `Googletest` 	for unit testing
- `log4cxx` 	for logging

The following preprocessor definitions (using the `-D` compiler flag) remove these dependencies, but also some functionality:

- `NOLOGGING`	removes all log statements
- `NOLOG4CXX`	replaces log statements with `std::cout` output if `log4cxx` is not available - loglevel `TRACE` becomes fixed.


Build
-----

We recommend SCons for building the project. Edit the file `SConstruct.EDITME` to set include paths, library paths etc, then rename it to `SConstruct`.

Alternatively, our Eclipse project files are included as examples in the `eclipse/` directory. Import the project into Eclipse and modify depending on your needs.


Test
----

Run all unit tests with 

		./CommunityDetection-debug --tests --gtest_filter=*Test*

Run performance tests with

		./CommunityDetection-optimized --tests --gtest_filter=*Benchmark*


Run
---

Required options for community detection are `--algorithm` and `--graph`.

Main algorithms:


	PLP		Parallel Label Propagation
	PLM		Parallel Louvain Method
	EPP		Ensemble Preprocessing

Example calls:


		./CommunityDetection --algorithm=PLP --graph=path/to/a.graph
		./CommunityDetection --algorithm=EPP:4*PLP+PLM --graph=path/to/a.graph
		./CommunityDetection --algorithm=PLM --graph=path/to/a.graph --runs=10 --summary=path/to/file.csv


The `--graph` option accepts graph files in a format known as the [METIS file format][metis], a simple adjacency list format. Many example files can be found in the collection of the [10th DIMACS Implementation Challenge][dimacs]. 

The default loglevel is INFO, add `--loglevel=DEBUG` for more or `--loglevel=ERROR` for less verbose output.

By default, all available threads will be used. To explicitly set the number of threads, use

	--threads=8

To perform 42 runs of the algorithm per graph, add

	--runs=42

To append key result data to a CSV file, add

	--summary=/path/to/file.csv

To save the clustering produced, add

	--saveClustering=/path/to/file.clust

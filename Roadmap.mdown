# NetworKit Roadmap

This document is about the current and future development of the NetworKit package.


## Release Notes

### 1.0

- static community detection algorithms


### 2.0 

- Python interface
- prototype of network properties overview

### 3.0

## Algorithms

- connected components
- parallel exact clustering coefficient
- betweenness centrality (Brandes algorithm)
- core decomposition
- exact diameter
- diameter approximation
- clustering coefficients approximation
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

## Generators

- Chung-Lu graph generator
- Havel-Hakimi graph generator (recreates degree sequences)

## Data Structures

- `Partition`: a data structure for disjoint partitions of a set, to replace `Clustering`
- `Cover`: a data structure for overlapping subsets of a set



## Roadmap

This list contains features which are due for a specific future release.

### 3.1

- betweenness approximation
- degreee assortativity approximation
- depth-first search
- degreee centrality



## Feature Wish List

This list contains features which may be added to NetworKit in the indeterminate future.

### Algorithms

- eigenvector centrality

### Generators

- hyperbolic graph generator

### Data Structures

- concurrent graph (to replace `Graph`)
- directed graph

### Visualization

- advanced dynamic visualization (possibly using sigma.js)


## Rejected Features

This list contains proposed features which will not be included in NetworKit.

- native graphical user interface - use IPython Notebook instead

Description: 
        NetworKit is a growing open-source toolkit for high-performance network analysis.
        Its aim is to provide tools for the analysis of large networks in the size range
        from thousands to billions of edges. For this purpose, it implements efficient
        graph algorithms, many of them parallel to utilize multicore architectures. These
        are meant to compute standard measures of network analysis, such as degree
        sequences, clustering coefficients and centrality. In
        this respect, NetworKit is comparable to packages such as NetworkX, albeit with a
        focus on parallelism and scalability. NetworKit is also a testbed for algorithm
        engineering and contains a few novel algorithms from recently published
        research, especially in the area of community detection.

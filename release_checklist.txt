The following list attempts to be a release checklist, which is not guaranteed to be complete:
* Development related (correct ordering might be useful):
    * Optional, if not already done during ongoing development:
        * Pull new features/code from forks into the Dev branch.
        * Merge branches into the Dev branch.
    * If not done in the branches and forks: Document changes relevant to the user in the appropriate files (markdown, PDF, IPython notebook).
    * Make sure, that the all the Unit tests (option '-t/--tests') run properly.
    * Make sure, that the user guide Notebook runs properly.
    * Update version number (setup.py, version.py).
    * Merge Dev branch into default (release) branch.
    * Set version tag in default branch.
    * Merge default branch back into Dev branch.

* Website related (automatic scripts would be nice...):
    * Write news item.
    * Update "getting started" page.
    * Update files (networkit.zip, PDF, user guide,...) and their links.
    * Update "documentation" page and C++ and Python documentations.

* Misc: Write a mail including release notes to the mailing list.
